# Hospital-Managment-system

This project building a complete Hospital Management System using Java and JDBC.  looking to enhance your Java skills, this project is a fantastic opportunity to learn and practice.

My main purpose create above project learing the JDBC.

we can connect our Java application with the MySQL database through the Java code. JDBC ( Java Database Connectivity) is one of the standard APIs for database connectivity, using it we can easily run our query, statement, and also fetch data from the database.

#### Prerequisite to understand Java Database Connectivity with MySQL
1. You should have MySQL on your System.
2. You should have JDK on your System.
3. To set up the connectivity, the user should have MySQL Connector to the Java (JAR file),
   the 'JAR' file must be in classpath while compiling and running the code of JDBC.

##### so you can downlaod MySQl Connecter Below link
[MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/?os=26)

##### Java Code to Connect to MySQL
`import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class MySQLConnectionExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
// JDBC URL, username, and password of MySQL server
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name";
String user = "your_username";
String password = "your_password";

        // JDBC variables for opening, closing, and managing connection
        Connection connection = null;

        try {
            // Establishing a connection to the database
            connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

            // Do something with the connection (e.g., execute SQL queries)

            System.out.println("Connected to the database!");
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.err.println("Error connecting to the database: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            // Closing the connection when done
            if (connection != null) {
                try {
                    connection.close();
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    System.err.println("Error closing the connection: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
