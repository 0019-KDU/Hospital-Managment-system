# Hospital-Managment-system

This project building a complete Hospital Management System using Java and JDBC.  looking to enhance my Java skills, this project is a fantastic opportunity to learn and practice.

My main purpose create above project learing the JDBC.

we can connect our Java application with the MySQL database through the Java code. JDBC ( Java Database Connectivity) is one of the standard APIs for database connectivity, using it we can easily run our query, statement, and also fetch data from the database.

#### Prerequisite to understand Java Database Connectivity with MySQL
1. You should have MySQL on your System.
2. You should have JDK on your System.
3. To set up the connectivity, the user should have MySQL Connector to the Java (JAR file),
   the 'JAR' file must be in classpath while compiling and running the code of JDBC.

##### so you can downlaod MySQl Connecter Below link
[MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/?os=26)

##### Java Code to Connect to MySQL
`

        try {
            // Establishing a connection to the database
            connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

            // Do something with the connection (e.g., execute SQL queries)

            System.out.println("Connected to the database!");
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.err.println("Error connecting to the database: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            // Closing the connection when done
            if (connection != null) {
                try {
                    connection.close();
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    System.err.println("Error closing the connection: " + e.getMessage());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
`

so next above sytem have below function

**üè•Managing Patients and Doctors: Learn how to add, view, and manage patient and doctor information within the system.**

**üóì **Booking** Appointments: Implement functionality to schedule appointments, ensuring a smooth healthcare scheduling process.**

**üïí Checking Doctor Availability: Create a feature that allows users to verify doctor availability for specific dates.**

so above project to create for use jave core and oop concept.
