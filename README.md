This project building a complete Hospital Management System using Java and JDBC.  looking to enhance your Java skills, this project is a fantastic opportunity to learn and practice.

My main purpose create above project learing the JDBC.

we can connect our Java application with the MySQL database through the Java code. JDBC ( Java Database Connectivity) is one of the standard APIs for database connectivity, using it we can easily run our query, statement, and also fetch data from the database.

#### Prerequisite to understand Java Database Connectivity with MySQL
1. You should have MySQL on your System.
2. You should have JDK on your System.
3. To set up the connectivity, the user should have MySQL Connector to the Java (JAR file),
   the 'JAR' file must be in classpath while compiling and running the code of JDBC.

##### so you can downlaod MySQl Connecter Below link
